# Version:  Used if a new set of energy rates needed to be added.
#           We cannot just replace energy rates because historical billing needs to know
#           what the energy rate was at THAT time of the historical point, not the current replaced rates.

# Priority: This field is included to future-proof additions to the "energy rate" db model.
#           Right now, we have models that will include a `Boolean` field for `is_weekday` or `is_weekend`.
#           In the future though, we may want a service rate for a certain day of the week, or even
#           a very specific day where the energy rate is supposed to be different and override the other models.
#           The priority field would be used to prioritize the specific day (or even the day-of-the-week)
#           energy rates over the energy rates that simply cover a weekend or weekday.
